# Multiple-Language-Detection
The code snippet is  for detecting (multiple) languages on given input sentence.</br>
Here I am using **langdetect** python library for detecting the languages.</br>

langdetect is one derived from Google language detection. As of now langdetect library detects 55 languages by calling simple function "detect". It will return the language code.</br>

- It is very fast
- Pre-trained over a large number of languages (currently 55)
- Single langdetect library file with minimal dependencies
- Deployable as a web service
